# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic staking pool contract. It allows users to create pools, stake, unstake and claim rewards. The contract also utilizes banadocs 
documentation tool. Some interaction like creating pool might fail due to the large amount of ether required.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn add @bonadocs/docgen

npx hardhat docgen

cd site

yarn

yarn start
```

This is the staking contract: 0xE3A6B5176e2E9132Ea2C19E0348e80746f681d5A
